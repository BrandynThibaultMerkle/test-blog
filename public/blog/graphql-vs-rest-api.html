    <p>REST APIs use fixed endpoints, whereas GraphQL provides flexible queries.</p>
    <p>GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching by allowing clients to request only the data they need.</p>
    <p>REST is simpler to implement and widely supported across platforms.</p>
    <p>GraphQL is ideal for complex applications that require optimized data retrieval.</p>
    <p>Choosing between REST and GraphQL depends on the specific needs of your project.</p>
